\section{Case Studies of Aerodynamic Shape Optimization}
\label{ch5:sec:cases}

In this section, we demonstrate the versatility of our approach in three distinct cases: minimizing drag from a 2D circle, optimizing the NASA's Common Research Model Wing~\cite{aa.Vassberg2008}, and optimizing a Blended-Wing-Body aircraft~\cite{aa.Liebeck2004}. Despite the substantial differences between these cases, we apply the same configuration for all 2D and 3D cases without any fine-tuning. This fixed configuration highlights the ease of using DeepGeo compared to the state-of-the-art FFD-based method, which we use as a baseline for comparison. Unlike FFD, our approach requires no careful configuration of control points across cases, eliminating the need to determine their number and positions, constrain the value ranges of design variables, or develop global design functions. Configuring FFD for different tasks and geometries is time-consuming, demands extensive expertise, and often relies on trial-and-error.
