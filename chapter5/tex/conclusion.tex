\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we presented DeepGeo, a fully automated, neural network-based parameterization model for aerodynamic shape optimization (ASO). DeepGeo addresses key limitations of traditional parameterization approaches by eliminating the need for extensive manual tuning or large training datasets. Additionally, its integration of volumetric mesh deformation significantly reduces implementation complexity, streamlining the ASO pipeline for easier deployment.

Through a series of case studies--ranging from 2D circle-to-airfoil optimization to 3D CRM wing and Blended-Wing-Body aircraft optimization--we demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of DeepGeo. It achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art free-form deformation methods without requiring the extensive manual intervention they typically demand. As a result, DeepGeo stands out as a promising solution for complex geometric parameterization in ASO.

Future work will focus on leveraging DeepGeo's robust geometric processing capabilities to develop advanced ASO applications, such as optimizing bio-inspired shapes or user-defined sketches. As a foundational shape parameterization tool, DeepGeo also has potential applications beyond ASO, where shape manipulation, geometric processing, and computational meshing for physical simulation are essential but labor-intensive.
