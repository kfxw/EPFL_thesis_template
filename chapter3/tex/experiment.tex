\section{Experiments}
\label{ch3:sec:Experiments}

We validate our proposed model on 2D airfoil geometries. We show it outperforms traditional mesh representations in (i) reducing the amount of handcraft designs, (ii) discovering geometric patterns automatically, (iii) representing both surfaces and entire CFD meshes and (iv) providing full differentiability to downstream applications.
