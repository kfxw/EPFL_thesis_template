\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we propose two deep learning models that fully automate shape parameterization for aerodynamic shape optimization. Both models eliminate the need for human intervention and directly manipulate high-dimensional mesh data. By learning continuous mappings of coordinate space, the models can deform both object surfaces and arbitrary types of computational meshes simultaneously. In the 2D airfoil optimization problem, our pipelines demonstrate comparable results with existing solutions based on handcrafted and semi-automatic parameterization methods. However, since the primary focus of this paper is on the parameterization model, other modules in the pipeline are not optimal. As an ongoing research project, we will continue to improve the overall performance by building better surrogate models and investigating meshes suitable for deformation. Meanwhile, we will continue to explore 3D object studies and apply deep geometric learning techniques to tackle more complex geometries.
